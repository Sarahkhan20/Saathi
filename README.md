## Saathi - Your Companion for Finding Flats and Roommates

Saathi is a web app designed to be your companion when you're new to a city, especially catering to the Indian audience. It aims to connect people with their preferred roommates and flats that fit their budget.

### Motivation

While there are many websites available in India for finding rented flats, Saathi goes beyond that. Being wanted to create a platform that not only helps you find a place to live but also enables you to find your perfect flatmate. As I like to call it the "Tinder to find your perfect flatmate."

### How Saathi Works

Saathi takes a unique approach by asking users a series of questions through a quiz. Based on their responses, a matching profile is created, showcasing the characteristics and preferences they have in common with potential roommates. Users themselves have a profile created based on the quiz, providing them with personalized recommendations.

### Feedback-Driven and Scalable

I believe in the power of user feedback. My goal is to continually improve Saathi based on the feedback received. I am aiming to make Saathi a scalable product that addresses the needs of the Indian market effectively.
